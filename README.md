# IW4C6: Relive the glory days.
![Highrise? Highrise!](https://github.com/CrazyCSIW6/iw4c6-raw/assets/51261276/506b1df9-da97-4c70-9230-ae23feab0e59)

## About this shit
IW4C6 is a singleplayer and multiplayer total conversion mod for IW4x.
The goal of IW4C6 is to keep the charm of the early MW2 era alive, fully offline in the comfort of your, uh... shitty gaming chair.
IW4C6 includes a near-finished recreation of the UI and menus from the day-one Xbox 360 version.
All the old glitches are back, same goes for the balancing. Or lack thereof.

As an added bonus you can play with friends and kick ass (including each others' asses), as well as go solo and tell the bots to suck it. And yes, they'll do the same to you. Not all games have to be easy.

Are you waiting for something? No? Then grab the fucking controller and haul ass!
