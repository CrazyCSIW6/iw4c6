# Important Information

## 1. This isn't finished
IW4C6 is not finished and is nowhere near finished at the moment.
I've done 99% of this solo with no help over the course of 2 years. If I want to get this mod finished any time soon, I'm going to need people helping me out with it.
If you think you can give a helping hand, shoot me a Discord message @crazycsiw6 (don't expect me to constantly be on this project. i'm severely depressed right now.)

## 2. This hasn't been entirely open sourced yet
While the raw files are easily accessible, the iw4x.dll file is unique and I haven't open sourced that yet.
Unfortunately it's nigh impossible to just decomp C++ so when I stop slacking on this project I'll find wherever the fuck I put the source and get it up here on GitHub.
